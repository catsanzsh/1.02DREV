# 1.02DREV Stress Testing Tool

## Overview
The 1.02DREV is a robust stress-testing framework designed to help developers and network administrators evaluate the resilience of their networks and systems under high-load scenarios. This tool simulates various types of traffic to understand how systems perform under stress, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks.

## Features
1. **Traffic Simulation**: Generates realistic traffic to test network throughput and system performance.
2. **Customizable Scenarios**: Users can define specific conditions under which the stress tests are performed.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Detailed reporting on how the system behaves under stress, including latency, throughput, and error rates.

## Ethical Use Disclaimer
This tool is intended for educational and testing purposes only. Use it only on networks and systems you have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized use of this tool against third-party systems is illegal and unethical.
